# Hi there 

I'm a Software Engineer. I studied at UNICAMP. I work mostly with mobile, IOT, cooking and, occasionally, gardening.
I used to compete in Robotics. Won 1st place at RoboCup in 2011, a competition organized by _RoboCup Federation_. Once a little kid, 13 years old, I touched a computed with the backdoor open. That was a path with no way back.  .    .

I'm looking for help with:
